            Let us talk a bit about operators first.

Operator is a symbol which does some operation on value(s) or variable(s). In C++ there are many operators, some of them are same as mathematic operators and some different.

There are mainly of 5 types of operators in C++ :
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Relational Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators

Besides these there are more operators, but let us focus on these one by one.

Arithmetic Operators

As the name says, these operators are used to perform mathematical operations.

+, -, *, and / have their usual meaning as mathematics.

There is one more cool arithmetic operator which directly gives us the reminder when an integer is divided by some integer. This is called modulo operator. The symbol is % (percentage symbol).

The syntax for modulo operator is :

dividend%divisor

Below is the code demonstrating the use of the operators we discussed above.
