            Assignment Operators
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            These are used to assign values to variables.

The simplest assignment operator is =, which assigns the value on the right to the variable on left.

int x = 20;

We have already such lines code. In above line = is used to assign the value 20 to the variable x.

We can use = between two variables.

x = y ;

The above line assigns the value of y to x.

Now comes the operator, +=.

+= adds the value on the right to the existing value of the variable.

int x = 10 ;

x += 20 ;

Now the value of x is 30, because += operator added 20 to the existing value which was 10.

Similarly we have,

-=, which subtracts value on right and from the existing value.

*=, which multiplies value on right and to the existing value.

/=, which divides value on left from the value on right and assigns the quotient to the variable on left.

%=, which divides value on left from the value on right and assigns the reminder to the variable on left. This works on integers only.
