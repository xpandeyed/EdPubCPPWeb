<div>Let us now see the first C++ program which every programmer in the world
    writes when he starts his/her journey.</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div>The complete understanding of this program requires understanding of
    objects, functions, datatypes etc.</div>
<div>But let us try to get the most we can learn from this
    program.</div>
<div><br />Every predefined entity we use in a program has some more code behind
    it. This background code is put into files, just to make things sorted. So when we use an entity, sometimes
    we need to mention some of those files at the top of the program. The first two lines are written to mention
    two files. Do not worry we will learn more about the same lines later.</div>
<div><br />Ignore the blank lines. They are used to make the code pretty.
</div>
<div><br />The next line says<span>&nbsp;<b>int main()</b></span>&nbsp;and is followed
    by some content in curly braces. The content surrounded by curly braces is a block of code, and this block
    of code is identified by a name,<span>&nbsp;<b>main</b></span>. Every C++ program must have a block of code with
    name,&nbsp;<span><b>main</b></span>.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This block has some pre-declared rules which must be followed. The rules
    say that main block of code must return 0 (zero). This 0 indicates the successful execution of the program.
    Just before the identifier <b>main</b>,<span>&nbsp;<b>int</b>&nbsp;</span>is written.
    This<span>&nbsp;<b>int</b>&nbsp;</span>is
    used to indicate that an integer value will be returned from this block of code.
    The&nbsp;<span><b>()</b></span>&nbsp;after the main are also necessary. They will be discussed
    later.<br /><br /></div>
<div>Anything written inside the main block is considered as a set of
    instructions for the computer by the programmer.</div>
<div><br />The line<span>&nbsp;<b>cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!" ;</b>&nbsp;</span>is an
    instruction for the computer, which is responsible for the output on the screen.</div>
<div><br />Next lesson is
    about<span>&nbsp;<b>cout</b>.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span></div>
<div>Next comes the return statement. The main block of code must <b>return 0</b>. It
    is a rule, and this return statement indicates successful execution of program. Which also means anything
    written after the return statement will not be executed.</div>
<div><br />One more thing some of the lines end with semicolon here. Semicolon
    in C++ is just like full stop in English. It denotes that the line has ended here. Almost all of the lines
    end with semicolon, only few special lines are exception to this.<br /></div>
