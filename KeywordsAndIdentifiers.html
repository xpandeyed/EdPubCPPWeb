            Keywords and Identifiers
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            So far you have learnt cout, endl etc. These words are have some purpose assigned to them and they must only be used for their respective purposes, else computer will get confused and you will get an error. These special words are called Keywords.

There are more such words but you do not need to memorize them by writing on your table. Instead when you learn a new keyword just remember that word and purpose assigned to it, from then.

In C++ we are allowed to create various entities which can be identified with some names. These names which are given by us to the entities are called Identifiers. We will use identifiers from next chapter.

There are some rules to give names to entities. They are as follows :

1. Any identifier must not match any keyword.

2. Any two identifiers can not be same.

3. Identifier must start with an alphabet character or an underscore.

4.The following characters of identifier can be underscores and numeric characters.

5. Any other character is not allowed, like spaces or special characters.

Here are some examples :
a, ab, A, _a, a1, num, fac, myNumber etc.

Here are some invalid identifiers :
1a, @a, my number etc.
