            Fundamental Datatypes

            In programming we often work on data. For our and computer's convenience the data has been categorized into several categories.

Some of these datatypes are completely predefined and are ready to use. These are called Fundamental Datatypes. Although there are seven fundamental datatypes but only six of them are used frequently. Let us learn these six fundamental datatypes one by one.

The first one is Integer datatype. Whenever we need to tell the computer that we are talking about Integer we use the keyword int, or we can say for integer, keyword int is used.

Every datatype occupies a fixed portion in computer memory. Since this size is fixed that is why each of the datatype has strict limits. These limits depend on the computer architecture and the compiler. But in most of the cases the size of portion occupied by integer data is 4 bytes, and the range of integers that can be stored in this size is -2147483648 to  +2147483647.

The second one is float datatype. They are the decimal numbers like -11.11, 12.569 etc. The keyword for floating point datatype is float. The typical size for floating point numbers is 4 bytes. They have precision of 6-9 significant digits, typically 7.

The third one is double datatype. They are also the decimal numbers like floating point numbers, but the difference is that Double Floating Point numbers occupy more memory, have wider range and are used when we need more precision. The keyword for double floating point numbers is double. The size occupied by a double floating point number is 8 bytes. They have precision of 15-18 significant digits, typically 16.

If we do not mention the datatype for a decimal number then by default the decimal number is interpreted as double floating point number.

The fourth is boolean datatype. It is used to store true or false. The keyword for boolean datatype is bool. Size for boolean datatype is 1 byte.

The fifth is character datatype. It stores single characters like a, A, b, B etc. The keyword for character datatype is char. The size of character datatype is 1 byte. Characters are always written in single quotes.

The sixth is void datatype. It is used to indicate absence of data. The keyword for Void datatype is void.
You will learn when and how to use these datatypes in next chapter.
