            So far whatever we have learnt we have never received some data from screen. Let us learn how to receive values from screen.

Before we receive some value, we need to reserve some space for it in computer's memory. So let us first declare a variable.

int x ;

Now to receive value of x from screen we use cin.

The syntax for cin is :

cin >> x ;

The >> (double closing angular brackets) is called stream extraction operator. This complete statement receives a value from screen and assigns it to x.
