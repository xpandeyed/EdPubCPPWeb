            To alter the flow, break and continue are used.

break :

This loop control statement is used to terminate the loop. As soon as the break statement is encountered from within a loop, the loop execution stops there, and computer continues to execute the code present just after the body of the loop.

Syntax : 
{
    //some statements
    break;
    //some statements
}

continue :

This loop control statement forces the loop to skip the current iteration and continue from the next iteration.

Syntax : 
{
    //some statements
    continue;
    //some statements
}

As soon as the continue statement is encountered, the next statements inside the loop are skipped.
