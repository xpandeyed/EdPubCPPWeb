            Loops
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            What if we need to print "Hello World" 100 times? You may think that we need to write cout << "Hello World." << enld ; 100 times.

But here comes a really cool thing called loop. Whenever we need to execute a block of code multiple times, we use loops.

There are three types of loops :

1. for loop

2. while loop

3. do while loop

for loop

The syntax for for loop is :

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body of-loop 
}

initialization is a statement, which tells the computer the start point for the loop and is executed only once, that also when the loop starts.

condition is the statement which is checked every time the block to be executed. If the condition is true only then the block is executed.

update is a statement which updates the expression on which the execution of loop depends.
