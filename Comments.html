            In our code we often need to write certain lines which are not meant to be a part of the code. We write them for our convenience, so that we can easily understand the code if we see it in future or if someone else sees it he understands it easily.

These lines are called Comments. These lines are not executed by the computer. They are just ignored.

How to write comments?

If we want to make a single line comment, we need to put // (two forward slashes) at the beginning of the line.

If we want to make a multi line comment we need to put /* at the beginning and */ at the end of the comment.

//Single line comment


/* Multi
line
comment*/
