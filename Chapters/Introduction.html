            Hello learner.

Let us start learning with the very basic question.
<br><br>
What is C++?<br>
So, in simple words C++ one of those languages which are used to give instructions to computers.
<br><br>
One such language is C. And C++ was developed as an extension for C. Bjarne Stroustrup added some features to C and created C++. So C++ is a super set of C, and every C program is a valid C++ program.
<br><br>
The major addition was, OOP concept. C does not have Object Oriented Programming support whereas C++ does.
<br><br>
What is the difference between an OOP language and non-OOP language?
<br>
Since you have just started off, we would not be digging deep into technical terms, but let us learn the basic difference.
<br><br>
In non-OOP languages, the programs revolve around the processes and procedures while in OOP languages the program can be made to revolve around objects (for now think of object as a synonym of data) and how these objects can be manipulated.
<br><br>
One more thing that must be known to you is that C++ is a case sensitive language. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as different. It is traditionally taught as, Rose is not rose in C++.
