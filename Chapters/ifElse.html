            While writing a program we often need to execute some statements if a certain condition is met. For such
            cases C++ provides us if statement.
            <br><br>

            The syntax :
<br><br>
            if keyword is written, followed by the condition which we want to check in round brackets and then the
            statements we want to execute.
            if(condition) <br>
            { <br>
            //some code here <br>
            } <br>
<br>
            This some code will only be executed only when the condition is true. If the condition is false the computer
            will not execute the block.
<br><br>
            The if statement is not limited to this only, it can have an else block also. This else block is put after
            the if block and is executed only if the condition is false.
<br><br>
            if(condition) <br>
            {<br>
            //some code <br>
            } <br>
            else <br>
            { <br>
            //some code <br>
            } <br>
            <br>
            This does not end here we can have multiple conditions also.
            <br><br>
            if(condition1)<br>
            {<br>
                <br>
            }<br>
            else if(condition2) <br>
            { <br>
<br>
            } <br>
            . <br>
            . <br>
            . <br>
            else
            { <br>
<br>
            } <br>

            The else statement is optional in each case.
<br><br>
            One more thing to notice is that, the conditions are checked in same sequence as they appear and once a
            condition is met all of the next conditions are ignored.
