            Assignment Operators
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            These are used to assign values to variables.
            <br><br>
The simplest assignment operator is =, which assigns the value on the right to the variable on left.
<br><br>
int x = 20;
<br><br>
We have already such lines code. In above line = is used to assign the value 20 to the variable x.
<br><br>
We can use = between two variables.
<br><br>
x = y ;
<br><br>
The above line assigns the value of y to x.
<br><br>
Now comes the operator, +=.
<br><br>
+= adds the value on the right to the existing value of the variable.
<br><br>
int x = 10 ;
<br><br>
x += 20 ;
<br><br>
Now the value of x is 30, because += operator added 20 to the existing value which was 10.
<br><br>
Similarly we have,
<br><br>
-=, which subtracts value on right and from the existing value.
<br><br>
*=, which multiplies value on right and to the existing value.
<br><br>
/=, which divides value on left from the value on right and assigns the quotient to the variable on left.
<br><br>
%=, which divides value on left from the value on right and assigns the reminder to the variable on left. This works on integers only.
