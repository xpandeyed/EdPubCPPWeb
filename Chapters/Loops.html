            Loops
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            What if we need to print "Hello World" 100 times? You may think that we need to write cout << "Hello World." << enld ; 100 times.
            <br><br>
But here comes a really cool thing called loop. Whenever we need to execute a block of code multiple times, we use loops.
<br><br>
There are three types of loops :
<br><br>
1. for loop
<br><br>
2. while loop
<br><br>
3. do while loop
<br><br>
for loop
<br><br>
The syntax for for loop is :
<br><br>
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body of-loop 
}
<br><br>
initialization is a statement, which tells the computer the start point for the loop and is executed only once, that also when the loop starts.
<br><br>
condition is the statement which is checked every time the block to be executed. If the condition is true only then the block is executed.
<br><br>
update is a statement which updates the expression on which the execution of loop depends.
