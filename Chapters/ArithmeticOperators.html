            Let us talk a bit about operators first.
            <br><br>
Operator is a symbol which does some operation on value(s) or variable(s). In C++ there are many operators, some of them are same as mathematic operators and some different.
<br><br>
There are mainly of 5 types of operators in C++ :
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Relational Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
<br><br>
Besides these there are more operators, but let us focus on these one by one.
<br><br>
Arithmetic Operators
<br><br>
As the name says, these operators are used to perform mathematical operations.
<br><br>
+, -, *, and / have their usual meaning as mathematics.
<br><br>
There is one more cool arithmetic operator which directly gives us the reminder when an integer is divided by some integer. This is called modulo operator. The symbol is % (percentage symbol).
<br><br>
The syntax for modulo operator is :
<br><br>
dividend%divisor
<br><br>
Below is the code demonstrating the use of the operators we discussed above.
